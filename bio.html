<p> My parents met in Florence, Italy and lived in Parma, where they had my two older sisters, before moving to Chicago. I was born and raised just outside the city, I went to a small public high school, and I left for Tufts in 2014. </p>

<p> I came into Tufts as an Economics and Environmental Studies double major. By the end of my freshman year, I had switched Economics for Computer Science. I am in my junior year, I work for a tech startup on campus, and I am looking forward to studying abroad next semester. </p>
